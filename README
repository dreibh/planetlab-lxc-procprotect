This module enables you to protect entries in /proc from untrusted users running in LXC containers. To use it:
- Load the module
- Add /proc entries to the blacklist by running echo "path-to-proc-entry" > /proc/procprotect

Caveats and todos:
- Only protects opens, not listings
- The ACL mechanism is currently very simple. Permission is denied to containers that have a non-root mount namespace. This will eventually be extended to cgroup-style ACLs.
